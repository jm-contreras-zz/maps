maps
====

**Repository of R scripts that draw map representations of world data using color to denote country statistics.** The repository also includes the maps output by the scripts.

- **maps.R** attempts to draw a map of the world with countries color-coded by population rank. Due to a mismatch of country names in the data and the map, the coloring is unreliable. Nonetheless, this script gives some sense of how the [*maps*](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maps/index.html) package creates color-coded maps like *maps.jpeg*.

- **rworldmap.R** uses the [*rworldmap*](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rworldmap/index.html) package to draw a map of the world with countries color-coded by population rank. The map is *rworldmap.jpeg*.
